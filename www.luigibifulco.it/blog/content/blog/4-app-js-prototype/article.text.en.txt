I'm looking for a web mobile framework. Native, web and hibryd everyone enable developers to solve one or some problems. I have to say that in the open source world there is no one solution. In this moment i can't find any solution that acts as a toolkit for solving "all common" problems. Probably this need does not exists yet.
In terms of needs, today i need to create a prototype of a mobile web app. For mission critical apps fast prototyping  is a real common problem. I found App.js and i believe it's a good framework for implementing a good base structure for navigational aspetecs of a webapp. Stay tuned for my impressions. Bye.
